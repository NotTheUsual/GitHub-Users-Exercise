# GitHub User Exercise

Small JS exercise (from Makers Academy week 7) to work with (a) the GitHub api, (b) adding content to a page with JQuery and (c) small CSS animations.

You can put in a GitHub username and the page will show you their username, profile picture and their bio, if they have one (which I'm pretty sure they don't - I've since had it pointed out to me by people who used the API more extensively that there isn't actually an obvious bio field on GitHub, and you never actually get one back...).

And that's that.
